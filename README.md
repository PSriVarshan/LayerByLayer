# LayerByLayer
An AI-powered framework for real-time oil spill detection using Sentinel-1 SAR satellite imagery and AIS vessel tracking data. By combining deep learning-based segmentation with anomaly detection in vessel trajectories, the system enables accurate, automated identification of oil spills while minimizing false positives through cross-verification.
